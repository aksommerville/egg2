/* font.h
 * Utilities for generating text labels in Egg, client-side.
 * Requires stdlib.
 * All entry points are null-safe.
 *
 * You provide source images containing the glyphs.
 *  - Same format as egg v1 (though this API is a brand new implementation).
 *  - Black and white.
 *  - Leftmost column is a control region: Black indicates a row start and white is the content of the row.
 *  - All rows across one font must be the same height.
 *  - - Note that the left control bar is largely redundant. We lean on that as a validation mechanism.
 *  - In the control row, alternate black and white to indicate the width of the glyph below. First glyph has a white control row.
 *  - Each of these glyphs can contain any count of glyphs (I typically cut at 16). If the final region in a glyph row has no set pixels, it's ignored.
 *  - Glyphs should contain all of their horizontal space. Typically one column on the right.
 *  - Limit 255 pixels per glyph on both axes.
 *  - Page dimensions limited to 256x256.
 *
 * All text is left-to-right. We can't do Arabic or Hebrew, sorry.
 * Also no ligatures, kerning, or other exceptional spacing arrangements: One codepoint is one glyph, and it always looks the same.
 * Glyphs not explicitly defined in your images are noop (in particular, no horizontal advancement).
 * Text is UTF-8. If misencoded, we treat it as 8859-1, one byte at a time.
