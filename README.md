# egg2

Engine for web and native games, retro style.
Most documentation is under [./etc/doc](./etc/doc/).

Differences from [Egg v1](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg):
- Custom build tool, similar to berry. Arbitrary targets selected at eggdev's build time, and web is not special.
- Direct access to data conversion a la carte via eggdev.
- Synth: Post pipes, LFOs, and stereo output.
- ~More input options: Keyboard, mouse, touch. Maybe accelerometer?~ Decided against this, after getting partway in.
- Single render call taking a struct of uniforms and a GPU-ready vertex buffer.
- No image decoder at runtime (egg 1 used to do this; it's actually been removed already).
- Rich built-in menu. Quit, input config, toggle music, toggle sound, language.
- Web apps pack to a Zip file with boilerplate HTML and the binary ROM. Same as berry. Also continue to allow standalone HTML as an option.
- eggdev --help reads from etc/doc/eggdev-cli.md directly.
- Default instruments live somewhere in the SDK.
- No Wasm runtime for native builds. If we want that in the future, it should be achievable but I don't expect to want it.

# TODO

- [ ] I'd really like `make run` from this project to rebuild the demo when libeggrt changes. Would be nice in external projects too.
- [ ] Programmatic access to a song eg for ocarinas or sustained notes. API change.
- - The synthesizers currently aren't built for infinitely-sustaining notes.
- - Need to think this thru carefully, and ensure we have some safeguards against stuck notes.
- [ ] Editor.
- - [ ] Standard actions... what's needed?
- - - Don't bother with map stuff; those tend to implement a little different per game, let the overrides worry about it.
- - - [ ] Detect missing strings across languages.
- - - [ ] Detect empty sound effects.
- - - [ ] Is it feasible to scan for missing resources? eg map names an image that doesn't exist.
- - [x] SongChannelsUi.onStore: Modal with SDK instruments
- - [ ] SongService: Should we auto-re-play on dirty?
- - [ ] SongService+SongChannelsUi: Mute and Solo buttons per channel.
- - [ ] SongChannelsUi: Copy levelenv when changing mode, and maybe do a per-mode default.
- - [ ] HexEditor: Paging, offset, ASCII, multi-byte edits.
- - [ ] ImageEditor: Animation preview like we had in v1.
- - [x] StringsEditor: Side-by-side editing across languages, like we had in v1.
- - [ ] DecalsheetEditor: Validation.
- - [ ] Generic command list support. Can we read a command schema off a comment in shared_symbols.h?
- - [ ] PostModal: Mysterious "invalid input" error on a newish channel. Can't repro.
- - [ ] Sounds require an explicit terminal delay. Have editor create this automagically from the events.
- - [ ] PostModal fields per stage type.
- - [ ] Launch game.
- - [ ] Song actions (SongChannelsUi)
- - [ ] ModecfgModal for drum: Spawn SongEditor in a modal per drum.
- [ ] eggdev
- - [ ] project: Update Makefile for serving runtime
- - [ ] eggdev_main_project.c:gen_makefile(): Serve editor and overrides.
- - [ ] project: README.md
- - [ ] `eggdev project`: Prep overrides.
- - [ ] eggdev build: Replace `<title>` in HTMLs.
- - [ ] `eau-format.md`: "Events for a channel with no header will get a non-silent default instrument.". Confirm we're doing this in both implementations.
- - - We're not. And if it seems burdensome, we can change the spec to require CHDR.
- - - If we change the spec, ensure that MIDI=>EAU generates all CHDR. Not sure whether it does.
- - [ ] `eau-format.md`: "Duration of a sound is strictly limited to 5 seconds.". I didn't implement this yet.
- - [ ] `src/demo/src/data/song/8-doors_without_walls.mid:WARNING: 3 notes were not released.`
- - [ ] src/eggdev/build/builder_infer_outputs.c:260:TODO: builder_infer_target_outputs_macos, still need some of the ancillary bits
- [ ] Native runtime.
- - [ ] Input.
- - - [x] Persist mappings.
- - - [ ] Interactive reconfig.
- - - - [ ] Let the client declare which buttons it uses, so when configuring we don't ask for all 15 buttons.
- - - - - Maybe a metadata field "incfgMask" containing characters "dswne123lrLR". "d" being the dpad, all others correspond to one button.
- - [ ] Record and playback session.
- - [ ] System language, for MacOS and Windows.
- - [ ] Global config file.
- [ ] Web runtime.
- - [ ] Input.
- - - [ ] Mapping.
- - - [ ] Live config.
- - [ ] prefs
- - [ ] web: Detect loss of focus. At a minimum, pause audio. Maybe pause everything? Probly needs new soft-pause support in synth.
- - [ ] web Video: Load raw pixels with non-minimum stride
- - [ ] web `egg_texture_get_pixels`
- - [ ] web Video: Determine whether border is necessary. Apply to main fb as needed too; right now it's only situated for id>1 textures.
- - [ ] web: Quantize final scale-up, don't use `object-fit:contain`.
- - [ ] web: Player count
- - [ ] synth: Test perceptually.
- - - Pay close attention to FM. I hacked it fast and loose for web, probably got it all wrong.
- - - Add some editor tooling to print a song both native and web, and play them back with an easy toggle.
- - [ ] synth: Confirm we can get decent whoosh, click, and snap sounds without subtractive voices. I'm not sure we can.
- - [ ] Web synth: tuned voices use the oscillator's `detune` for both wheel and pitchenv. I expect they will conflict.
- - - Probably related to that, FM voices really can't bend at all, the modulator goes out of sync.
- - [ ] Web playhead incorrect for songs shorter than the forward period. That's a tricky one, and not likely to matter. Apparent in drumtest.
- [ ] Generic menu: Input config, quit, audio, language.
- - [ ] Native.
- - [ ] Web.
- [ ] Client utilities.
- - [ ] stdlib
- - [ ] graf
- - [ ] font
- - [ ] Standard instruments and sound effects.
- [ ] Should we allow strings to use symbolic names in place of index? I'm leaning No but give it some thought. We do something like that for decalsheet.
- [ ] macbook: etc/tool/genbuildconfig.sh: line 23: realpath: command not found
- [ ] macbook: [make] find: -executable: unknown primary or operator
- [x] macbook: Is "-framework" not a thing anymore? How do we link against Frameworks?
- - No, our link command is getting mangled somewhere: ...ggstra/eggstra_play.o -framework -lm -lz AudioUnit Cocoa CoreGraphics IOKit OpenGL Quartz
- - It's an ill-advised `$(sort)` in linking eggstra. Just let LDPOST be duplicated.
- [x] macbook: /local/config.mk: Failed to read Egg's build configuration.
- - Because I added "macos_OBJC"?
- [ ] genbuildconfig.sh: Generated blank EGG_SDK (macbook)
- [x] macbook, linking rom: __egg_embedded_rom undefined
- - Too many underscores? It is present in src/demo/mid/macos/data.o, but with a single leading underscore.
- [ ] macbook: `make run` is not MacOS-savvy: `make: src/demo/out/demo-macos: No such file or directory`
- [x] 2025-09-04 21:59:17.781 demo[3515:40896] Unknown class AKAppDelegate in Interface Builder file at path /Users/andy/proj/egg2/src/demo/out/demo-macos.app/Contents/Resources/Main.nib.
- - It is present in libeggrt.a. Is AKAppDelegate getting tree-shook out at link? ...looks like it. Mitigated in macos.m.
- [ ] EGG_GLSL_VERSION. Currently pretty hacky.
