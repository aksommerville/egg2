# egg2

Engine for web and native games, retro style.
Most documentation is under [./etc/doc](./etc/doc/).

Differences from [Egg v1](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg):
- Custom build tool, similar to berry. Arbitrary targets selected at eggdev's build time, and web is not special.
- Direct access to data conversion a la carte via eggdev.
- Synth: Post pipes, LFOs, and stereo output.
- ~More input options: Keyboard, mouse, touch. Maybe accelerometer?~ Decided against this, after getting partway in.
- Single render call taking a struct of uniforms and a GPU-ready vertex buffer.
- No image decoder at runtime (egg 1 used to do this; it's actually been removed already).
- Rich built-in menu. Quit, input config, toggle music, toggle sound, language.
- Web apps pack to a Zip file with boilerplate HTML and the binary ROM. Same as berry. Also continue to allow standalone HTML as an option.
- eggdev --help reads from etc/doc/eggdev-cli.md directly.
- Default instruments live somewhere in the SDK.
- No Wasm runtime for native builds. If we want that in the future, it should be achievable but I don't expect to want it.

# TODO

- [ ] Programmatic access to a song eg for ocarinas or sustained notes. API change.
- [ ] Editor.
- - [ ] Standard actions... what's needed?
- - [ ] SongChannelsUi.onStore: Modal with SDK instruments
- - [ ] SongService: Should we auto-re-play on dirty?
- - [ ] SongService+SongChannelsUi: Mute and Solo buttons per channel.
- - [ ] SongChannelsUi: Copy levelenv when changing mode, and maybe do a per-mode default.
- - [ ] HexEditor: Paging, offset, ASCII, multi-byte edits.
- - [ ] ImageEditor: Animation preview like we had in v1.
- - [ ] StringsEditor: Side-by-side editing across languages, like we had in v1.
- - [ ] DecalsheetEditor: Validation.
- - [ ] Generic command list support. Can we read a command schema off a comment in shared_symbols.h?
- - [x] MapEditor: Refresh image after editing commands.
- - [x] MapEditor: New map should default to `NS_sys_mapw,h`
- - [x] Editor: Copy resource.
- - [x] Right-click on resource, all the proposed types are red, even the default one. ...SidebarUi copies res, and I forgot "type".
- - [x] MapEditor: Toolbar reacts to modifier keys when a modal is open; it shouldn't.
- - [x] MapEditor: Opening commands modal, implicitly click "+" on entry. They can leave it blank and it's noop.
- - [ ] PostModal: Mysterious "invalid input" error on a newish channel. Can't repro.
- - [x] Opening raw modecfg: Uncaught ReferenceError: defaultModel is not defined
- - [ ] Sounds require an explicit terminal delay. Have editor create this automagically from the events.
- - [ ] PostModal fields per stage type.
- - [ ] Launch game.
- - [ ] Song actions (SongChannelsUi)
- - [ ] ModecfgModal for drum: Spawn SongEditor in a modal per drum.
- [ ] eggdev
- - [x] New EAU-Text format.
- - - [x] Incorporate text in eggdev's MIDI<~>EAU.
- - - [x] Remove vestigial EAU-Text from editor; plain EAU carries text now.
- - - [x] Incorporate text in song editor.
- - - [x] Return instruments as EAU, not EAU-Text. (continue storing as EAU-Text).
- - - [x] Some way to strip text from EAU at the final build.
- - [ ] project: Update Makefile for serving runtime
- - [ ] eggdev_main_project.c:gen_makefile(): Serve editor and overrides.
- - [ ] project: README.md
- - [ ] `eggdev project`: Prep overrides.
- - [ ] eggdev build: Replace `<title>` in HTMLs.
- - [x] `eggdev_convert_audio.c:eggdev_wav_from_eau`: Arbitrary params from user for conversion? (rate,chanc,method) in this case.
- - [ ] `eau-format.md`: "Events for a channel with no header will get a non-silent default instrument.". Confirm we're doing this in both implementations.
- - - We're not. And if it seems burdensome, we can change the spec to require CHDR.
- - - If we change the spec, ensure that MIDI=>EAU generates all CHDR. Not sure whether it does.
- - [ ] `eau-format.md`: "Duration of a sound is strictly limited to 5 seconds.". I didn't implement this yet.
- - [ ] `src/demo/src/data/song/8-doors_without_walls.mid:WARNING: 3 notes were not released.`
- [ ] Native runtime.
- - [ ] Input.
- - - [ ] Persist mappings.
- - - [ ] Interactive reconfig.
- - - - [ ] Let the client declare which buttons it uses, so when configuring we don't ask for all 15 buttons.
- - - - - Maybe a metadata field "incfgMask" containing characters "dswne123lrLR". "d" being the dpad, all others correspond to one button.
- - - [ ] Nix queue.
- - - [ ] Select player.
- - [ ] Record and playback session.
- - [ ] System language, for MacOS and Windows.
- [ ] Web runtime.
- - [ ] Input.
- - - [ ] Mapping.
- - - [ ] Live config.
- - [ ] prefs
- - [ ] web: Detect loss of focus. At a minimum, pause audio. Maybe pause everything? Probly needs new soft-pause support in synth.
- - [ ] web Video: Load raw pixels with non-minimum stride
- - [ ] web `egg_texture_get_pixels`
- - [ ] web Video: Determine whether border is necessary. Apply to main fb as needed too; right now it's only situated for id>1 textures.
- - [ ] web: Quantize final scale-up, don't use `object-fit:contain`.
- - [ ] web: Player count
- - [ ] synth: Test perceptually.
- - - Pay close attention to FM. I hacked it fast and loose for web, probably got it all wrong.
- - - Add some editor tooling to print a song both native and web, and play them back with an easy toggle.
- - [ ] synth: Confirm we can get decent whoosh, click, and snap sounds without subtractive voices. I'm not sure we can.
- - [ ] Web synth: tuned voices use the oscillator's `detune` for both wheel and pitchenv. I expect they will conflict.
- - - Probably related to that, FM voices really can't bend at all, the modulator goes out of sync.
- - [ ] Web playhead incorrect for songs shorter than the forward period. That's a tricky one, and not likely to matter. Apparent in drumtest.
- [ ] Generic menu: Input config, quit, audio, language.
- - [ ] Native.
- - [ ] Web.
- [ ] Client utilities.
- - [ ] stdlib
- - [ ] graf
- - [ ] font
- - [ ] Standard instruments and sound effects.
